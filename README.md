Twidio
======

Twidio is an integration of Twilio's and Rdio's API that allows songs to be added into a playlist through text messaging. Conceived and created by me during Bitcamp 2014, the University of Maryland 2014 hackathon. This server is particularly useful during parties when the songs on the host's playlist can be crowdsourced.
